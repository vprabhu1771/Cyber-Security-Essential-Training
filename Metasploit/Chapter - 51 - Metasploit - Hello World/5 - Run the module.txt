run


You should see the output:

[+] Hello, World!
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed


This is a very basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would replace the `print_good` line with the actual functionality you want your module to perform, such as interacting with a target system. Customize the module according to your specific requirements.

Keep in mind that this is just an auxiliary module for demonstration purposes. If you are creating an exploit module or post-exploitation module, you'll need to include additional code and functionalities based on the nature of your module.

set RHOSTS 192.168.1.73
