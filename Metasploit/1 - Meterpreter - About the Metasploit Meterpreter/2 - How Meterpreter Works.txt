The target executes the initial stager. This is usually one of bind, reverse, findtag, passivex, etc.

The stager loads the DLL prefixed with Reflective. The Reflective stub handles the loading/injection of the DLL.

The Metepreter core initializes, establishes a TLS/1.0 link over the socket and sends a GET. Metasploit receives this GET and configures the client.

Lastly, Meterpreter loads extensions. It will always load stdapi and will load priv if the module gives administrative rights. All of these extensions are loaded over TLS/1.0 using a TLV protocol.
