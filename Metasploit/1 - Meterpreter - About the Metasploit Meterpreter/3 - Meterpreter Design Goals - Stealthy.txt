Meterpreter resides entirely in memory and writes nothing to disk.

No new processes are created as Meterpreter injects itself into the compromised process and can migrate to other running processes easily.

By default, Meterpreter uses encrypted communications.

All of these provide limited forensic evidence and impact on the victim machine.
