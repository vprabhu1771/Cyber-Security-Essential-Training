New features are added to Meterpreter by loading extensions.


    The client uploads the DLL over the socket.

    The server running on the victim loads the DLL in-memory and initializes it.

    The new extension registers itself with the server.

    The client on the attackers machine loads the local extension API and can now call the extensions functions.


This entire process is seamless and takes approximately 1 second to complete.

In the next Metasploit Unleashed tutorial weâ€™ll discuss some of the various Meterpreter Commands available to us in this new environment.
