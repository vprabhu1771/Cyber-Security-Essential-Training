Use the upload command to upload a file from your local machine to the target machine.

upload /path/to/local/file /path/to/remote/location


Replace /path/to/local/file with the path of the file on your local machine that 
you want to upload, and /path/to/remote/location with the desired location on the 
target machine.

Once the file transfer is complete, you can verify its presence on the target machine.
