Description:
  This module extracts saved Wireless LAN profiles. It will also try 
  to decrypt the network key material. Behavior is slightly different 
  between OS versions when it comes to WPA. In Windows Vista/7 we will 
  get the passphrase. In Windows XP we will get the PBKDF2 derived 
  key.
