To detect the operating system and write the output to a specific text editor on Windows or 
macOS using the USB Rubber Ducky, you can modify the Ducky Script as follows:

For Windows:

DELAY 1000
GUI r
STRING cmd
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" > %userprofile%\Desktop\os_info.txt
ENTER

This script will first wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), 
then simulate pressing the "Windows" key and the "R" key together to open the "Run" dialog box. 

It will then type "notepad" and press Enter to open Notepad. 
Finally, it will run the "systeminfo" command and filter the output to display only the 
operating system name and version, and then save the output to a text file named "os_info.txt" on the user's desktop.
