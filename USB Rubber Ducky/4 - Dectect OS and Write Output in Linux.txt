To detect the operating system and write the output to a specific text editor on Linux using the USB Rubber Ducky, you can modify the Ducky Script as follows:

For Linux:

DELAY 1000
GUI r
DELAY 500
STRING gnome-terminal
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING uname -a > ~/Desktop/os_info.txt
ENTER

This script will first wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), then simulate pressing the "Windows" key and the "R" key together to open the "Run" dialog box. It will then type "gnome-terminal" and press Enter to open a Terminal window. Finally, it will run the "uname -a" command and redirect the output to a text file named "os_info.txt" on the user's desktop.

Note that this script assumes that the target Linux machine has a GNOME desktop environment installed, which is the default desktop environment for many popular Linux distributions. If the target machine uses a different desktop environment or terminal emulator, you'll need to modify the script accordingly.

Once the script has run, the output will be saved to the specified text file on the Linux machine.
