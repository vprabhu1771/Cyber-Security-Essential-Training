# 1 - Programming a USB Rubber Ducky

Programming a USB Rubber Ducky involves writing a script in a scripting language that the device can understand. 
Here are the basic steps to programming a USB Rubber Ducky

    First, connect your USB Rubber Ducky to your computer using a USB port.

    Next, you'll need to download the appropriate software for programming the device. 
    Popular options include the Duck Toolkit or Encoder by Hak5.

    Once you have the software installed, you can start writing your script. 
    The most commonly used scripting language for the USB Rubber Ducky is called Ducky Script, 
    which is a simple language that uses a series of keystrokes to execute commands. 
    You can find examples of Ducky Script commands online to help you get started.

    Once you've written your script, save it to a text file with a .txt extension.

    Open the Encoder software and load your script into the tool. Select the appropriate options 
    for your operating system and choose the language you used to write your script.

    Click the Encode button to generate the payload file. This file is what you will copy onto your USB Rubber Ducky.

    Finally, copy the payload file to the root directory of your USB Rubber Ducky, safely eject the device, and it's ready to use.

It's important to note that while the USB Rubber Ducky can be a powerful tool for legitimate security testing purposes, 
it can also be used for malicious purposes. Always use the device responsibly and with the appropriate authorization.
