generally all the configured WIFIs with their passwords are stored in wpa_supplicant.conf which saved in

/data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf

but you cant access it unless you have root permission.

you can pull the file by this command

if using windows

adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf c:\

if using ubuntu

adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf ~/
