To copy the DCIM folder (containing camera photos and videos) from an Android device to your desktop using ADB and a Python script, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure your Android device is connected via USB and debugging mode is enabled.

2. Create a Python script with the following code:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import shutil

# Define the source and destination paths
source_folder = '/sdcard/DCIM'
destination_folder = os.path.expanduser('~/Desktop/DCIM')

# Define the ADB command to copy the DCIM folder to a temporary location
adb_copy_command = ['adb', 'pull', source_folder, destination_folder]

try:
    # Create the destination folder on your desktop if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(destination_folder, exist_ok=True)

    # Copy the DCIM folder from the connected Android device to your desktop
    subprocess.run(adb_copy_command, check=True)
    print("DCIM folder copied to desktop.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

3. Run the Python script. It will send the ADB command to copy the DCIM folder from the connected Android device to your desktop.

The script uses the `adb pull` command to copy the entire DCIM folder to the specified destination folder on your desktop.

Please note that the paths and folder names may vary depending on your device's configuration. Additionally, copying large amounts of data might take some time, so please be patient.

As always, exercise caution when interacting with your device via ADB and ensure you have proper permissions and knowledge before making any changes.
