To list the storage information on an Android device using ADB and a Python script, you can use the following example:

1. Ensure your Android device is connected via USB and debugging mode is enabled.

2. Create a Python script with the following code:

```python
import subprocess

# Define the ADB command to get storage information
adb_storage_command = ['adb', 'shell', 'df']

try:
    # Get storage information from the connected Android device
    result = subprocess.run(adb_storage_command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    storage_output = result.stdout
    print(storage_output)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

3. Run the Python script. It will send the ADB command to retrieve storage information from the connected Android device.

The script uses the `df` command through ADB to display the disk space usage for different partitions on the device.

Please note that the output of the `df` command might vary depending on the Android device and version. The script above captures and prints the output as-is. If you want to parse and display specific storage information, you may need to modify the script accordingly.

Always be cautious when interacting with your device via ADB and ensure you have proper permissions and knowledge before making any changes.
