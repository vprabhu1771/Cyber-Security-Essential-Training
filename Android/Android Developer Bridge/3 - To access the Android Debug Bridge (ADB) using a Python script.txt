To access the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) using a Python script, you can use the `subprocess` module to execute ADB commands. Here's a simple example of how you might achieve this:

```python
import subprocess

# Define your ADB command
adb_command = ['adb', 'devices']

# Execute the ADB command using subprocess
try:
    result = subprocess.run(adb_command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    output = result.stdout
    print(output)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error executing ADB command: {e}")
```

Make sure you have the ADB executable (usually named `adb`) in your system's PATH, or you can provide the full path to it in the `adb_command` list. The above example demonstrates listing connected devices using the `adb devices` command. You can modify the `adb_command` list to execute other ADB commands as needed.

Remember to have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed on your system to use ADB. This code is just a basic starting point, and you can expand upon it to suit your specific needs.
