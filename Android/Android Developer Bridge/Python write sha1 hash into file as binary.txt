Certainly! Here's an example of how you can calculate the SHA-1 hash of a string and then write the hash value into a file as binary data:

```python
import hashlib

# Input string
input_string = "Hello, world!"

# Calculate SHA-1 hash
hash_object = hashlib.sha1(input_string.encode())
sha1_hash = hash_object.digest()

# Write hash to a file as binary
with open('hash.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(sha1_hash)
```

In this example, the `hashlib` library is used to calculate the SHA-1 hash of the input string `"Hello, world!"`. The `.digest()` method returns the hash value as bytes, which is then written to a file named `'hash.bin'` in binary mode (`'wb'`). Make sure to replace `'hash.bin'` with the desired filename and path.
