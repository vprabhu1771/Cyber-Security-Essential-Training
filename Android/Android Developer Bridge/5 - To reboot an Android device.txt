Certainly! Here's an example of how you can use Python and ADB to reboot an Android device:

```python
import subprocess

# Define the ADB command to reboot the device
adb_reboot_command = ['adb', 'reboot']

try:
    # Reboot the connected Android device
    subprocess.run(adb_reboot_command, check=True)
    print("Device is rebooting...")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This script sends the ADB command to reboot the connected Android device. When you run this script, the device will initiate a reboot. Make sure your device is connected via USB and debugging mode is enabled.

As always, be cautious when rebooting devices remotely, and ensure you have proper permissions to perform such actions on the device.
