An Android backdoor refers to a hidden or unauthorized access point in an Android application or system that can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, control, or manipulate the device's data, functions, or resources. Backdoors can be intentionally or unintentionally created and can pose significant security risks if not detected and addressed. They are often used by hackers or cybercriminals to carry out various malicious activities without the user's knowledge or consent.
