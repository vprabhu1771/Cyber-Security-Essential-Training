To access Android messages via ADB (Android Debug Bridge), you can use the following steps:

### 1. **Set Up ADB:**
   - Ensure you have ADB installed on your computer. You can download it as part of the Android SDK platform tools from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
   - Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device.
   - Connect your Android device to your computer via USB.

### 2. **Check ADB Connection:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify that your device is connected:
     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```
   - This should list your device with its serial number.

### 3. **Access SMS Database:**
   Android stores SMS messages in a database located at `/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db`. To access it, use the following command:

   ```bash
   adb shell
   su
   cp /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db /sdcard/
   exit
   adb pull /sdcard/mmssms.db
   ```

   This sequence of commands:
   - Enters the Android shell.
   - Switches to superuser (root) mode.
   - Copies the `mmssms.db` file to the SD card.
   - Exits the shell.
   - Pulls the `mmssms.db` file from the SD card to your computer.

### 4. **View SMS Database:**
   The `mmssms.db` is a SQLite database. You can open it using any SQLite viewer or database management tool, such as DB Browser for SQLite.

### 5. **Query SMS Data:**
   If you prefer to view the messages directly via ADB without pulling the database, you can run SQL queries on the `mmssms.db` using ADB shell:

   ```bash
   adb shell
   su
   sqlite3 /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db
   .tables
   SELECT * FROM sms;
   ```

   This will show you all the messages stored on your device.

### **Important Notes:**
   - Accessing the SMS database usually requires root access. If your device isn't rooted, these commands might not work.
   - Be cautious when handling sensitive data and ensure that you comply with privacy laws and regulations.

This method allows you to access and view your SMS messages directly from an Android device via ADB.
